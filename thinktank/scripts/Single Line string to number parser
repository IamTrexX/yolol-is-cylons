Takes a single yolol cycle per digit to decode a number that has been converted to a string

d: current digit
r: input string
n: current decoded digit
e: accumulator for decoded number
t: number base used (most likely base 10)
j: which digit is being decoded, needs to be reset every new number

Script starts at number 5, and progressively narrows down which digit is the one that has been extracted from the string
each step adds or subtracts from the current "guess", by the end the correct digit is reached. The last add / subtract is rolled
into e+=, which adds the decoded digit to 'e' accumulator. Goto is used to loop back to the same line. Loop is broken when the r
input string is empty and r---r throws a runtime error

d=r---r n=8-6*(d<5) n+=2*((d>n)-(d<n)) e+=(n+(d>n)-(d<n))*t^j++ goto 1
